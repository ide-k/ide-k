### Hi 👋
I'm Siddharth, most people call me Sidd. I enjoy coding, robotics and spending time with my dog, Goggles!
Currently working node.js, a robot, and my website. I also teach robot programming for my FIRST Robotics team.

Fun Fact: 🐶 My Profile Picture is of a friend's old dog in a sock that I photoshopped
